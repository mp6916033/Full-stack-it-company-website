    <p> Blockchain is a chain of blocks which contain permanent database as a ledger, recording all the transactions that have taken place in a secure, chronological, and immutable way.</p>
        <p>Blockchain has its Primary application in the field of Cryptocurrencies.<br> It shows great promise across a wide range of business applications like Banking, Finance, Government, Healthcare, Insurance, Media &Entertainment, Retail, etc.

            <b>Working Mechanism Of Blockchain</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Blockchain perform user transactions without involving any third party intermediaries. In order to perform transactions, all one needs to have BLOCKCHAIN  Wallet. It is a Program that allows one to spend cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETC etc.<br>
Such Wallets are secured by  Cryptographic methods(public and private keys) so that one can manage and have full control over his transactions.<br>
Initially when a user creates a transaction over a Blockchain network, a block will be created, representing that transaction is created.<br> Once the block is created, the requested transaction is broadcasted over the peer-to-peer network, consisting of Computers, known as nodes, which then validate the transaction.
Once the transaction is verified, it is combined with other blocks to create a new block of data for the ledger.<br>

        <h2>
            Blockchain Ecosystem
        </h2>
        <p>
            Blockchain ecosystem consists of network of nodes, chain database, backend blockchain services components, smart contact or chain code, web API, & client application. Network of nodes means network of systems together form blockchain network. Chain database is backend database use dfor persisting transactions blocks in key value database. Backend blockchain services components such as Validator, Endorser, Ordering, Consensus and Web API service plays a vital role in processing transaction data and form blockchain. Chain code or smart contact is a pluggable software component for processing the user transaction before committing into blockchain database.
